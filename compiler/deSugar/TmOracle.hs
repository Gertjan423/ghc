{- Note [The Pos/Neg invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Invariant: In any 'TmState', whenever there is @x ~ C@ in 'tm_pos',
an entry @x :-> cs@ in 'tm_neg' may only have incomparable 'PmAltCons' according
to 'decEqPmAltCons'.

For example, it would make no sense to say both
    tm_pos = [...x :-> 3...]
    tm_neg = [...x :-> [4,42]...]
The positive information is strictly more informative than the negative.
On the other hand
    tm_pos = [...x :-> I# y...]
    tm_neg = [...x :-> [4]...]
We want to know that @x@ is certainly not the literal 4 when we know it is a
@I#@. Notice that @PmAltLit 4@ and @PmAltConLike I#@ are incomparable. In
general, we consider every binding in 'tm_neg' informative when the equality
relation to the solution is undecidable ('decEqPmAltCons').

Now, suppose we are adding the (positive) fact @x :-> e@ to 'tm_pos'. Then we
must delete any comparable negative facts (after considering them for
refutation) for @x@ from 'tm_neg', to uphold the invariant.

But there is more! Suppose we are adding @x :-> y@ to 'tm_pos', and 'tm_neg'
contains @x :-> cs, y :-> ds@. Then we want to update 'tm_neg' to
@y :-> (cs ++ ds)@, to make use of the negative information we have about @x@,
while we can *completely* discard the entry for @x@ in 'tm_neg'.

{- Note [Refutable shapes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a pattern match like

    foo x
      | 0 <- x = 42
      | 0 <- x = 43
      | 1 <- x = 44
      | otherwise = 45

This will result in the following initial matching problem:

    PatVec: x     (0 <- x)
    ValVec: $tm_y

Where the first line is the pattern vector and the second line is the value
vector abstraction. When we handle the first pattern guard in Check, it will be
desugared to a match of the form

    PatVec: x     0
    ValVec: $tm_y x

In LitVar, this will split the value vector abstraction for `x` into a positive
`PmLit 0` and a negative `PmLit x [0]` value abstraction. While the former is
immediately matched against the pattern vector, the latter (vector value
abstraction `~[0] $tm_y`) is completely uncovered by the clause.

`pmcheck` proceeds by *discarding* the the value vector abstraction involving
the guard to accomodate for the desugaring. But this also discards the valuable
information that `x` certainly is not the literal 0! Consequently, we wouldn't
be able to report the second clause as redundant.

That's a typical example of why we need the term oracle, and in this specific
case, the ability to encode that `x` certainly is not the literal 0. Now the
term oracle can immediately refute the constraint `x ~ 0` generated by the
second clause and report the clause as redundant. After the third clause, the
set of such *refutable* literals is again extended to `[0, 1]`.

In general, we want to store a set of refutable shapes (`PmAltCon`) for each
variable. That's the purpose of the `PmRefutEnv`. This extends to
`ConLike`s, where all value arguments are universally quantified implicitly.
So, if the `PmRefutEnv` contains an entry for `x` with `Just [Bool]`, then this
corresponds to the fact that `forall y. x ≁ Just @Bool y`.

`tryAddRefutableAltCon` will add such a refutable mapping to the `PmRefutEnv`
in the term oracles state and check if it causes any immediate contradiction.
Whenever we record a solution in the substitution via `extendSubstAndSolve`, the
refutable environment is checked for any matching refutable `PmAltCon`.

Note that `PmAltConLike` carries a list of type arguments. This purely for the
purpose of being able to reconstruct all other constructors of the matching
group the `ConLike` is part of through calling `allCompleteMatches` in Check.
